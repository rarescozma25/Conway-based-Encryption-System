# LifeCrypt: Conway-based Encryption System

Welcome to LifeCrypt, a unique project that combines the fascinating simulation of Conway‚Äôs Game of Life with a symmetric encryption scheme. Built entirely in x86 Assembly using AT&T syntax, this project demonstrates efficient low-level programming while providing a practical method for encrypting messages.

### What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with low-level programming using Assembly with AT&T syntax. I learned how to represent and manipulate a 2D matrix to simulate Conway‚Äôs Game of Life, including handling edge cases by extending the matrix. Additionally, I developed robust file I/O skills by reading from and writing to files, and I implemented the use of `fflush` to ensure that output buffers are cleared immediately. I also deepened my understanding of bitwise operations, specifically XOR encryption and decryption, and how these operations can be used to create a dynamic, symmetric encryption scheme.


üìù **Description**  
LifeCrypt consists of two integrated components:

1. **Conway‚Äôs Game of Life Simulation**
   - Implements the classic rules:
     - **Underpopulation**: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
     - **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to live.
     - **Overpopulation**: A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
     - **Reproduction**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
   - The system state is represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s, with an extended border (cells outside the grid are considered dead) for accurate neighbor calculations.
   - The simulation evolves over k iterations, generating new states (S1, S2, ‚Ä¶) from an initial configuration S0.

2. **Symmetric Encryption Scheme (_1.S)**
   - Uses the evolved state (<S0, k>) from Conway‚Äôs Game of Life as a dynamic encryption key.
   - The key is generated by concatenating the rows of the extended matrix from the k-th evolution.
   - The plaintext message is first converted to its binary (ASCII) form and then XORed with the key:
     - If the message and key have the same length, each bit is XORed element by element.
     - If the message is shorter than the key, only the corresponding portion of the key is used.
     - If the message is longer than the key, the key is repeated as needed.
   - The resulting encrypted message is displayed in hexadecimal format, and decryption is performed using the same XOR operation.

‚ú® **Key Features**

- **Conway‚Äôs Game of Life Simulation**:
  - Implements classic cellular automata rules for dynamic state evolution.
  - Uses an extended matrix to correctly handle edge cells.
  - Supports k-evolution iterations to observe complex behaviors.

- **Symmetric Encryption**:
  - Dynamically generates an encryption key from the evolved cellular automata state.
  - Performs XOR-based encryption for secure message processing.
  - Adapts to messages of varying lengths by repeating or truncating the key.
  - Displays encrypted output in hexadecimal, with straightforward decryption via XOR.
